This project was an early attempt to modernize the internals of
SQL::Translator. It is currently mothballed.

If you want to contribute changes and improvements to what is currently
known as SQL::Translator on CPAN please go to
https://github.com/dbsrgits/sql-translator

The later-dated convert-in-place approach taken on the original codebase
turned out to be much more workable. Also the availability of Moo (which
happened way after the rewrite effort in this branch started) allowed
for a much nicer and performant codebase.

This particular codebase may eventually be picked up by someone else,
but it will *NOT* be a successor to what is currently known as
SQL::Translator on CPAN. It does not follow a direction any of the
current SQL::Translator maintainers is comfortable with.
